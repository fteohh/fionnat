Project Components:

I integrated two types of external content into my website: a YouTube video and Google Slides.
I wanted to show visitors more details about one of my projects and the YouTube video I used showcases its functionality. 
Itâ€™s an interactive project and providing a moving demonstration helps provide readers with a compelling representation. 
For similar reasons, I integrated two Google Slide decks into one of my project descriptions. 
Instead of reinventing the wheel, I decided that including the entire presentation alongside my general overview of the project would be helpful to provide a fuller picture of the project.

I also included a data collection from with five fields (first name, last name, email address, subject, and message), and used three differnt types of fields 
(text, email, and submit). The form also supports form validation and checks to make sure an email address is inputted correctly.
