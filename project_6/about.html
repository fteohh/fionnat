          <h2>A bit about me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm Fionna, my pronouns are she/they, and I'm an aspiring product designer who seeks
            to foster empathy and positive change through user experience, and visual design. I grew up
            in Fort Smith, AR, and currently live in Evanston, IL, as a third year student at Northwestern
            University studying Computer Science and Japanese. <br><br>

            I grew up as an art kid and always strive to combine my passion for visual art with creative
            problem-solving. My interest in issues such as accessiblity, social justice, and sustainability also guide
            my design approach to center inclusivity and functionality in problem solving. <br><br>

            Beyond school and work, I can be found on a long nature stroll, exploring new parts of the city, throwing
            clay on a pottery wheel, and gushing over thrift finds.<br><br>
