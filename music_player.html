            <h3>Music Player Concept<br>Student Project | Fall 2020</h3>
            <p id="text-body"><br>
              Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br><br>

              Task: Build a mobile music player application with core web technologies to understand website
              structure and implement a web application following web content accessibility guidelines. <br><br><br>

              The first stage consisted of implementing a two-screen music player interface showing an album and song select
              screen using HTML and CSS.<br><br>

              The four albums shown here are example albums that follow a consistent, complementary color theme.<br><br>

              The second stage was the implementation of the music player screens using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br><br>

              Each button triggers its corresponding action and is consistent with the music player's status, simulating playback.<br><br><br>

              <u>Takeaways:</u> This project was one of my first experienes working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I had fun learning and gaining a
              new skillset. I'd like to use this knowledge in a greater capacity in the future in order to improve, problem-solve, and create more intentionally.
